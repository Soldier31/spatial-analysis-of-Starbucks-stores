Introduction
============

Starbucks is one of the most iconic brands in the world, it's green-and-white siren seemingly emblazoned on every street corner. Initially a small specialty coffee roaster and cafe, Starbucks focused on coffee bean origins, espresso beverages, a dark roasting style and consumer experience to blossom into the coffee titan of today. At the same time, the company's scale and branding became increasingly pervasive as their product began to appear in nearly every major retail store and available commercial space. It would be valid to argue that it was the very success of Starbucks that birthed it's counter-movement, Third Wave coffee. The Third Wave seeks to return the focus of coffee to coffee itself, instead of the brand, by highlighting an even greater level of detail to processing style, alternative methods of coffee-making, coffee varietals, tasting notes and growing regions. We are beginning to see an increased appreciation for coffee as an artisanal foodstuff, rather than a widely available commodity.

The coffee industry is well aware of this growing trend and each company has adopted a different strategy to catch the Third Wave. For exmaple, Peet's Coffee & Tea, chose to acquire new third wave roaster's such as Intelligentsia and Stumptown to capture this new wave of coffee drinkers. Starbucks doubled-down and decided to leverage their in-house expertise to develop a new unique brand. The end result is the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room. This new line of developing business focuses on cultivating a premium and upscale experience by spotlighting limited small-lot batches, siphon flights of Reserve coffee, alternative brewing methods and pairings with artisanal food offerings. The goal is to enable Starbucks to better compete with regional and local coffee stores to capture this new high-end segment of the market. In the 2016 Annual Letter to Shareholders, Executive Chairman Howard Schultz outlined his plan to launch 20 - 30 new Roasteries in major global cities and then scaling up this experience by opening approximately 1,000 Reserve stores and incorporating Reserve bars into new and existing stores. This new line of Reserve stores are expected to double the financial performance of traditional Starbucks stores.

In this analysis, we will visualize the density of Starbucks Store Locations.

**Please note that this is a work in progress. I think there is still a lot to learn from this dataset and I will push new updates as I continue to learn more about spatial analysis.**
